    "# Node centrality assignment\n",
    "For this assignment we will be exploring node centrality in an effort to get an intuitive feel for what the various centrality metrics tell us about the nodes in the graph. For this assignment we will be using the [Dolphin social network](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/dolphins.zip). Download the graph and load it as a networkx graph using the [networkx functions](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/readwrite.html). If you have any difficulty loading in a graph you can attempt to load it into Gephi and then save it as a .net (pajek) and then load that version into networkx."

    "## Centrality in Networkx\n",
    "Networkx has several functions available for calculating the centralities of the nodes in the graph. There are functions for [eigenvector](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.eigenvector_centrality.html), [katz](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.katz_centrality.html), [closeness](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.closeness_centrality.html), [betweenness](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.betweenness_centrality.html), [degree](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.degree_centrality.html), etc. For a full list you can visit the [documentation page](http://networkx.readthedocs.io/en/networkx-1.11/search.html?q=centrality&check_keywords=yes&area=default). The functions take a graph as an argument and return a dictionary with nodes as keys and the centrality as values. This is convenient for us because we can set these as attributes for the nodes in the graph using the [`set_node_attributes`](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.9/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.set_node_attributes.html) function.
